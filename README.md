# PowerBI Project: Covid-19 in Africa

## Project Overview

The "[Covid-19 Africa](https://github.com/bankoleifeolukayode/Project-4/blob/main/COVID19-%20Africa.pbix)" PowerBI project is a data visualization endeavor aimed at providing insights into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the African continent. This project, hosted on GitHub, leverages PowerBI to analyze and present key metrics, trends, and patterns related to the virus's spread, healthcare infrastructure, vaccination progress, and demographic factors across African countries.

## Project Components

1. **Data Aggregation:**
   - Curated and aggregated data from reputable sources such as global health organizations, national health departments, and reliable databases to ensure a comprehensive and reliable dataset.

2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation:**
   - Employed rigorous data cleaning and transformation processes to address discrepancies, missing values, and ensure data consistency. This step is crucial for accurate analysis and visualization.

3. **Geospatial Analysis:**
   - Utilized geospatial analysis to create interactive maps, visually representing the geographical distribution of COVID-19 cases in African countries. Highlighted infection rates, recovery rates, and mortality rates for a holistic view.

4. **Time-Series Analysis:**
   - Implemented time-series analysis to showcase the temporal evolution of COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and deaths. Identified trends and patterns over time to understand the dynamics of the pandemic.

5. **Dashboard:**
   - Created a dedicated dashboard to track and visualize the COVID Case Predictions by Country (worst and best Performing) as well as featuring the combined and comparative recovery and mortality rate. Hence display the overall impact on controlling the spread of the virus.

6. **Demographic Insights:**
   - Integrated demographic data to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on different demographic profiles.
